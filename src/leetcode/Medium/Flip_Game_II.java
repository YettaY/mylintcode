/**
 * Created by yanglu on 16/8/7.
 * You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

 Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

 For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".

 Follow up:
 Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.


 The idea is try to replace every "++" in the current string s to "--" and see if the opponent can win or not, if the opponent cannot win, great, we win!

 For the time complexity, here is what I thought, let's say the length of the input string s is n, there are at most n - 1 ways to replace "++" to "--" (imagine s is all "+++..."), once we replace one "++", there are at most (n - 2) - 1 ways to do the replacement, it's a little bit like solving the N-Queens problem, the time complexity is (n - 1) x (n - 3) x (n - 5) x ..., so it's O(n!!), double factorial.
 If we use HashMap to memorize both win string & lose string, we can further reduce time

        Map<String, Boolean> map = new HashMap<>();
        return canWin(s, map);
    }

    public boolean canWin(String s, Map<String, Boolean> map){
        if(map.containsKey(s))
            return map.get(s);
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            if(s.charAt(i) == '+' && s.charAt(i + 1) == '+') {
                String opponent = s.substring(0, i) + "--" + s.substring(i + 2);
                if(!canWin(opponent, map)) {
                    map.put(s, true);
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
