 * A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

 Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.

 For example,
 Given low = "50", high = "100", return 3. Because 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.

 Note:
 Because the range might be a large number, the low and high numbers are represented as string.

 Construct char array from lenLow to lenHigh and increase count when s is between low and high. Add the stro pairs from outside to inside until left > right.
