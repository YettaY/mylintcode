/**
 * Created by yanglu on 16/8/8.
 * You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

 Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

 For example, given s = "++++", after one move, it may become one of the following states:

 [
 "--++",
 "+--+",
 "++--"
 ]
 If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].

public class Flip_Game {
    public List<String> generatePossibleNextMoves(String s) {

        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length()-1; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '+' && s.charAt(i + 1) == '+') {
                list.add(s.substring(0, i) + "--" + s.substring(i+2, s.length()));
            }
        }

        return list;

    }
